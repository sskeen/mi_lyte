## 🔮 mī lyte: Alignment, feasibility, and optimization of an LLM emotion regulation intervention to deliver just-in-time mindfulness skills and PrEP education

![A web browser screenshot showing a chatbot interface. The sidebar reads: mi lyte: Accessible mindfulness skills for everyday life. mHEAL: Mindfulness for Health Equity Lab. A disclaimer reads: mī lyte is a tool to provide knowledge on stress and resilience, recommending evidence-based informal mindfulness practices to build into your everyday life. mī lyte is not a replacement for in-person therapy. It does not provide medical or psychiatric advice. The user query reads: I have too much to deal with today! I feel so overwhelmed I can't even start. The response reads: It sounds like you're in the midst of a stress spiral—overwhelm leads to frustration, which makes everything feel harder. Remember, this is temporary but can feel endless if we don’t pause. Here’s what helps: Mindful Breathing: Take 3 deep breaths. Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 6. This grounds you and calms your nervous system. Acknowledge Your Feelings: It’s okay to feel overwhelmed—don’t fight it. Label what you’re feeling (e.g., “I’m stressed”) without judgment. Try this: Write down one thing you can do right now, no matter how small. Check it off when done. You’ve already succeeded! A prompt for additional dialogue reads: I could use some help with...](images/sample.png)

A prototype developed by [Dr. Simone Skeen](https://sites.brown.edu/mheal/team/#simone) for [mHEAL: the Mindfulness for Health Equity Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/mheal/) at Brown University, grounded in _Mindfulness-Based Queer Resilience_ © [Dr. Shufang Sun](https://sites.brown.edu/mheal/team/#shufang). Uniquely, to our knowledge, mī lyte combines a mindfulness-based stress resilience (MBSR; System 1) and a PrEP education (System 2) intervention, leveraging the unique strengths of Transformer-based LLMs and traditional (pre-scripted) text message banks, respectively, in an Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills–grounded manner.[^1]

Early life adversity is shown leading to chronic stress reactivity, which can lead to maladaptive coping, depression, hazardous alcohol use, illicit drug use, and condomless and/or serostatus-unaware sex. In contrast, chronic stress reactivity can be decoupled via mindfulness-based stress regulation, leading to emotion regulation, accurate risk perception, and PrEP knowledge and eventual PrEP uptake, aided by mi lyte System 1 and System 2.](images/conceptual_model.jpg)

### 🍂 System 1
Tapping a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, user-queried stressors to mī lyte elicit MBSR skills recommendations to practice in real time. "Retrieval-augmented generation" refers to a system in which specialized knowledge is “retrieved” from a knowledge base – Dr. Sun’s internet mindfulness-based intervention manual (NCCIH #K23AT011173), in mī lyte – to “augment” a response “generated” by an LLM.[^2] This knowledge base can be personalized by the end user to incorporate individual resilience assets: inspiring song lyrics, aspects of faith and spirituality. Prioritizing safety, mī lyte System 1 will firmly but politely refuse queries that are outside of the context of its MBSR knowledge base. 

### 🍑 System 2
PrEP education encoded in a pre-scripted text message bank will be navigable to users via a deterministic dialog tree. Circumventing the probabilistic process by which LLMs generate responses, System 2 eliminates the possibility of “factuality hallucinations,” i.e. inaccurate medical information, addressing an urgent challenge in healthcare AI.[^3]
